### Installation Notes
___

It is easier to setup raspberry pi if you do the following:

```

1.  Manually configure the Wifi
2.  Install openssh-server on the Pi
3.  Enable auto-login on pi configuration
4.  Setup TightVNC for remote graphical interface

```
When TightVNC is installed and configured, enable it on Systemd so it will start everytime the OS does.
